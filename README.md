# LoCoBotRos

This repository holds my workspaces for learning ROS2 using the Trossen Robotics Locobot. The robot uses the Kobuki drive base, and Intel Realsense D435 on a pan-tilt servo, and the Trossen Robotics wx-200 5-dof arm.

## Usage
---
All the packages here are intended to be run on a machine running Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop with ROS2 Humble installed. Refer to [the locobot documentation](https://docs.trossenrobotics.com/interbotix_xslocobots_docs/getting_started/user_guide.html) for usage of the provided control and definition packages.

More information will come soon, including installer scripts for the robot and a remote workspace.
