[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:19 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findinterbotix_xs_driver.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "interbotix_xs_driver", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "interbotix_xs_driver" with any of the following names:

    interbotix_xs_driverConfig.cmake
    interbotix_xs_driver-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "interbotix_xs_driver" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "interbotix_xs_driver_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "interbotix_xs_driver" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
