  By not providing "Findros2_control_test_assets.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "ros2_control_test_assets", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "ros2_control_test_assets" with any of the following names:

    ros2_control_test_assetsConfig.cmake
    ros2_control_test_assets-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ros2_control_test_assets" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "ros2_control_test_assets_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "ros2_control_test_assets" provides
  a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
